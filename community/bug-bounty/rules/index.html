<p>Please read these terms and conditions (these “<strong>Terms</strong>”), which form a legally binding contract between Polymesh Association (“<strong>Polymesh</strong>” or “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>” in context) and qualifying individuals (“<strong>Participant</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>” and “<strong>your</strong>” in context) who wish to participate in this bug bounty program (the “<strong>Program</strong>”) and identify vulnerabilities in our in-scope products (“<strong>Vulnerabilities</strong>”). Participants that submit acceptable Vulnerability Reports shall be eligible to earn a payout (a “<strong>Bounty Payout</strong>”), as determined solely at Polymesh&#x27;s discretion, in accordance with these Terms.</p>
<p>These Terms include important clauses, including without limitation, instances where Participants may be liable to Polymesh, a class action waiver, and other limitations of your rights and remedies. Disputes will be adjudicated solely in Canton of Zug, Switzerland. By participating in the Program, all Participants must agree to be bound by these Terms and comply with these Terms. If an individual does not wish to, or cannot comply with these Terms, they are ineligible for a Bounty Payout and must not participate in the Program.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-overview-and-eligibility">(1) OVERVIEW AND ELIGIBILITY<a href="#1-overview-and-eligibility" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to (1) OVERVIEW AND ELIGIBILITY" title="Direct link to (1) OVERVIEW AND ELIGIBILITY">​</a></h3>
<p>Polymesh offers this Program as an initiative for our community members that are helping Polymesh to improve the Polymesh protocol.</p>
<p>The Program is not a competition. No fees are payable or purchase is necessary to participate in the Program. There is no guarantee that you will earn a Bounty Payout. The Program is provided “as-is”.</p>
<p>This Program is a discretionary initiative. Polymesh, in its sole discretion, may modify these Terms at any time and may modify, restrict, suspend, terminate, or otherwise change any aspect of this Program, and/or the fulfillment of any Bounty Payouts at any time, as noted in Section 7 below.</p>
<p>You must meet the following criteria in order to be eligible to be a Participant:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You must be either the legal age of majority in your country or at least 14 years of age with permission from your legal guardian that you may participate in the Program;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When acting as a Participant, you are not violating any other agreement (i.e. employment agreement) to which you may be a party - we are not liable for any breach of such third party agreement by you and disclaim any knowledge of or responsibility for your conduct; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are not listed under or resident in a country that is under a US, Switzerland, European Union, or United Nations embargo or sanctions list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Polymesh employees, contractors or representatives, or a family member of a Polymesh employee, contractor or representative, are not eligible to participate in the Program during the term of engagement with Polymesh and for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination of such engagement.</p>
<p>These Terms are the entire agreement between you and Polymesh for your participation in the Program and these Terms will supersede any prior agreement between you and us.</p>
<p>A Participant may be required to provide Polymesh with proof of compliance and eligibility in the form requested in regards to any obligation of the Participant hereunder.</p>

<p>We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with Participants. You agree that when you provide us your email address or personally identifying information (e.g. name, address) during or prior to access or involvement in the Program, you: (a) consent to receive communications from us in electronic formats, including via the email address you have submitted or other agreed upon contact methods; (b) can opt-out from receiving communication from us at any time; and (c) agree that these Terms, agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if they were in writing and physically presented to you.</p>
<p>Public announcements regarding the Program will be made in the <a href="https://discord.gg/ud2deWAnyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polymesh Developer Discord Channel</a>. Notifications in connection with submitted Reports, Bounty Payouts, and your participation in the Program will be made by email using your email address provided. It is each Participant&#x27;s sole responsibility to receive and monitor those methods to timely receive, review, and respond as needed to notifications. Failure to timely respond or complete any of the steps set forth in the notification and verification procedures for any reason, including filtering or failure by Participant to notice or accept a communication from Polymesh or its representative, may result in disqualification of such Participant from receiving the Bounty Payout. Polymesh reserves the right to contact Participants for verification purposes and administration of the Program. All Polymesh&#x27;s decisions are final and binding in all matters relating to the Program.</p>
<p>All notices provided to Polymesh in relation to the Program shall be sent to <a href="mailto:bugbounty@polymesh.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bugbounty@polymesh.network</a>.</p>

<p>Participants will receive Bounty Payouts upon satisfying criteria for such payouts on their Reports, subject to verification. See Exhibit B for current information regarding Bounty Payouts, including how Bounty Payouts are calculated (collectively, “<strong>Rewards Details</strong>”). We may change the Bounty Payouts and the manner in which they are calculated at any time. All Bounty Payout details not specified in these Terms (including Exhibit B) will be determined at Polymesh&#x27;s sole discretion. Bounty Payouts are not the property of any Participant until such payouts are actually received by a Participant.</p>
<p>Bounty Payouts are paid in United States Dollars or USDC on Ethereum and shall be sent using the details provided by Participant as specified in Exhibit B. Polymesh is not responsible for a Participant&#x27;s inability to accept or receive a Bounty Payout for any reason. <strong>We are not able to issue Bounty Payouts to Participants who are in violation of a material term of these Terms, including being on a sanctions list or that reside in countries on a sanctions list</strong>.</p>
<p>Any taxes (federal, national, state, prefectural, territorial, provincial, and/or local) and other costs and expenses associated with Bounty Payout acceptance or receipt will be the sole responsibility of the Participant. No more than the stated Bounty Payout will be awarded. Polymesh will not replace any lost or stolen Bounty Payouts or any Bounty Payouts that are undeliverable or do not reach the Participant because of an incorrect or changed address or contact information. If a Participant does not accept the entire Bounty Payout, the unaccepted part of the Bounty Payout will be forfeited, and Polymesh will have no further obligation with respect to that Bounty Payout or portion of the Bounty Payout. Participants are strictly prohibited from selling, auctioning, trading, or otherwise transferring their entitlements to Bounty Payouts. Polymesh may be unable to make Bounty Payouts (for example, if prevented by a government or regulatory agency), impractical (e.g. excessive transfer costs, duties, or taxes), or impossible for Polymesh to award to Participants who live in certain jurisdictions. Polymesh reserves the right, but not the obligation, to cancel the payment of such Bounty Payout in such circumstances. Each Participant waives the right to assert as a cost of receiving any Bounty Payout any and all costs of verification and costs to claim the Bounty Payout and any liability and publicity which might arise from claiming or seeking to claim said Bounty Payout.</p>
<p>Participants may be required to respond to an initial notification from Polymesh within forty-eight (48) hours and be required to provide necessary details so Polymesh can make the Bounty Payouts.</p>

<p>Participant will be liable for and indemnify Polymesh, its subcontractors, and their respective directors, officers, and representatives (“<strong>Polymesh Indemnitees</strong>”) against any losses which Polymesh Indemnitees may incur that arise from Participant&#x27;s breach of these Terms, including losses arising from Participants&#x27; gross negligence, willful misconduct and breach of law.</p>
<p>In no event will Polymesh be liable to you for any loss of use, revenue or profit or loss of data or for any consequential, incidental, indirect, exemplary, special, aggravated, or punitive damages whether arising out of breach of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, regardless of whether such damage was foreseeable and whether or not Polymesh had been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything else set out under these Terms, our cumulative liability to you under these Terms (apart from payment of Bounty Payout to which you may be entitled) shall be $10. Participant further waives all rights to have damages multiplied or increased.</p>

Any legal actions, suits, or proceedings related to this Program (whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct, or otherwise) will be brought exclusively in the courts of the Canton of Zug and each Participant irrevocably accepts, submits, and consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts with respect to any legal actions, suits, or proceedings arising out of or related to this Program. You waive any and all objections to jurisdiction and venue in these courts and hereby submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Canton of Zug, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Except where prohibited, as a condition of participating in this Program, each Participant agrees that between the parties, any and all disputes, claims, and causes of action arising out of or connected with this Program, or the Bounty Payout awarded must be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action.</p>

<p>We may terminate your engagement with us and any entitlement to any Bounty Payout if you violate any part of these Terms. Polymesh reserves the right to restrict or void participation from any identifiable source if any suspicious participation is detected or any violation of these Terms is suspected or detected. Polymesh reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to void the participation of any Participant who Polymesh believes has attempted to tamper with or impair the administration, security, fairness, or proper execution of the Program. If Polymesh determines at any time, in its sole discretion, that a Participant is engaging in behavior that Polymesh deems obnoxious, deceptive, inappropriate, threatening, illegal or that is intended to annoy, abuse, or harass any other person, Polymesh reserves the right to disqualify that Participant.</p>
<p>Sections 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and this clause shall survive termination of the Program.</p>

<ul>
<li>Participant Name</li>
<li>Participant Address</li>
<li>Phone Number</li>
<li>Email Address</li>
<li>Wire Information (Bank Name, Bank Address, Account Number, SWIFT Code)</li>
<li>Crypto Address (for payment to be made in USDC)</li>

<p>Bounty Payouts are processed twice a month - on the 15th, and on the last day of the month, so expect the Bounty Payouts to reach you within 10 days from the closest upcoming processing date.</p>
<p>Please note that we can not issue Bounty Payouts to individuals, entities, or residents of countries that are listed in the U.S. Department of The Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions list, Switzerland State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) sanctions list, European Union (EU) sanctions list or the United Nations (UN) Security Council sanctions list.</p>

<p>Where we receive multiple Reports about the same or similar Vulnerability, we will reward a Bounty Payout only for the first Report received. In addition, multiple Vulnerabilities that relate to one underlying Vulnerability will be treated as one Vulnerability and entitled to one Bounty Payout.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer
