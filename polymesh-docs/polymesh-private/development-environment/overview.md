To ease the initialisation of a developer environment for Polymesh Private instances, we provide a Docker compose file that spins up a Polymesh Private chain, and all associated tooling.

The repository [https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/Polymesh-private-dev-env](https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/Polymesh-private-dev-env) provides the required docker files and configuration for this.

This environment includes:

- A Polymesh Private Node
- REST API
- Proof API
- GraphQL API
- Hashicorp Vault (for managing signing keys)

Please see this projects README for details on how to quickly launch an environment.
