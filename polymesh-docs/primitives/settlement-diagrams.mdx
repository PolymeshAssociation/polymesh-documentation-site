## Purpose of Sequence Diagrams

These sequence diagrams provide a detailed overview of the steps involved in the settlement process for Assets. They outline each step comprehensively, from account setup to instruction creation, affirmation, rejection, and execution.

It's important to note that these diagrams offer a low-level representation, including all steps of the listed process. This level of detail ensures clarity and precision in understanding the settlement process.

When using tools such as the Polymesh REST API or the Polymesh Typescript SDK, some of the steps depicted in these diagrams are combined into a single user action. These tools can simplify the process for integrators, streamlining the integration of Assets.

## Asset Creation

In this sequence diagram, the asset issuer creates, configures and issues an asset. In this flow the issuer does this directly, but it is also possible to delegrate the configuration and issuance steps to an agent once the asset has been created.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant I as Issuer
participant P as Polymesh

Note over I: Issuers can directly issue, or specify an agent to issue on their behalf
opt
  I ->> P: Register Asset Ticker
end
I ->> P: Create Asset
opt
  I ->> P: Specify Asset Metadata
end
opt
  I ->> P: Specify Asset Compliance Rules
end
I ->> P: Issue (mint) Asset
```
# Asset Agent Management

In this optional sequence diagram, the asset issuer permissions an external agent to operate their asset on their behalf.

Agents can be granted granular permissions so that they can only operate specific features (e.g. documentation updates) as needed.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant I as Issuer
participant A as Agent
participant P as Polymesh

I ->> P: Issue `BecomeAgent` Authorization
Note over I,P: Specifies Ticker, Agent DID and Agent Permission Group
A ->> P: Accept `BecomeAgent` Authorization
Note over I, P: Once an Agent has been permissioned,they can act on behalf of the Issuer<br/>with respect to this asset
```

# Asset Venue Creation

In this step the asset issuer (or their agent) creates a new distribution venue to distribute their asset. Every settlement instruction in Polymesh is related to a particular settlement venue, and only the creator of that venue can specify who is allowed to sign receipts for off-chain asset transfers.

In addition the issuer of an asset can optionally manage which venues they allow their asset to trade within.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant I as Issuer / Agent
participant P as Polymesh

I ->> P: Create a Venue
Note over I,P: Venue Details, Type and Receipt Signers provided
P ->> I: New Venue ID
Note over I,P: Venue ID is emitted in an event
opt
  I ->> P: Specify Additional Allowed Venues
end
opt
  I ->> P: Update Allowed Receipt Signers on Issuer Venue
end
opt
  I ->> P: Update Venue Details for Issuer Venue
end
```

# Asset Settlement / Distribution

In this step an asset is settled between a sender and receiver. In this example both the sender and receiver configure a custodian who does the affirmation step on their behalf - this approach is optional, and you can see in the next example that we have the sender and receiver affirming directly rather than via a custodian.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant I as Issuer / Exchange
participant S as Asset Sender
participant R as Asset Receiver
participant SC as Sender Custodian
participant RC as Receiver Custodian
participant M as Mediator
participant P as Polymesh

par
  S ->> P: Issue Custody Authorization for Sender Custodian
  SC ->> P: Accept Custody Authorization
and
  R ->> P: Issue Custody Authorization for Receiver Custodian
  RC ->> P: Accept Custody Authorization
end

I ->> P: Create Settlement Instruction between Sender and Receiver

par
  SC ->> P: Affirm Settlement Instruction as Sender
  P ->> P: Sender Assets Locked
and
  RC ->> P: Affirm Settlement Instruction as Receiver
  P ->> P: Receiver Assets Locked
and
  opt
    M ->> P: Affirm Settlement Instruction as Mediator
  end
end

I ->> P: Execute Settlement Instruction
```

# Asset Settlement  / Distribution with Off-Chain Leg

In this step we show the sequence when a settlement instruction involves both an on-chain leg (to move a security issued directly on Polymesh) as well as an off-chain leg representing an asset moving on a chain or payment system outside of Polymesh.

In this case we have synchronised settlement between the off-chain and on-chain legs (rather than atomic settlement) with signed data being provided via an "OffChain Signer API" to verify that the off-chain leg was completed, before the settlement instruction is finalised on Polymesh.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant I as Issuer / Exchange
participant S as Asset Sender
participant R as Asset Receiver
participant M as Mediator
participant O as OffChain Signer API
participant P as Polymesh

I ->> P: Create Settlement Instruction between Sender and Receiver
note over I,P: Settlement Instruction includes an on-chain asset (sender to receiver)<br/>and an off-chain asset (receiver to sender)

par
  S ->> P: Affirm Settlement Instruction
  P ->> P: Sender Assets Locked
and
  R ->> O: Request Signed Receipt the Off-Chain Asset Has Been Transferred
  O ->> R: Signed Receipt Provided
  R ->> P: Affirm Settlement Instruction via Signed Receipt
and
  opt
    M ->> P: Affirm Settlement Instruction
  end
end

I ->> P: Execute Settlement Instruction
```
