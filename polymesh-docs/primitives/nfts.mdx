# Non-Fungible Token 

## Overview

The NFT pallet extends the Asset pallet allowing users to create NFT collections, issue unique tokens and redeem (i.e. burn) existing non-fungible tokens. The documentation for the NFT crate can be found [here](https://docs.polymesh.live/pallet_nft/index.html).

## NFT Collection

All non-fungible tokens are linked to a unique NFT collection, which is tied to an [Asset](https://developers.polymesh.network/polymesh-docs/primitives/assets/#asset-creation) and user-defined metadata.

### Creating an NFT Collection

In order to successfully create an NFT collection, the dispatchable [`create_nft_collection`](https://docs.polymesh.live/pallet_nft/struct.Module.html#arguments) must be called, and the following conditions must hold:
* If the asset already exists, it must be of type `NonFungible` and the caller must have the proper permission for the asset. Otherwise, the `create_nft_collection` dispatchable will also create one non-fungible asset using the values passed as `ticker` and `nft_type`; 
* This must be the first collection associated to the given `ticker` (i.e. only one collection per ticker is allowed);
* The number of metadata keys associated to the collection must be less or equal to [MaxNumberOfCollectionKeys](https://docs.polymesh.live/pallet_nft/trait.Config.html#associatedtype.MaxNumberOfCollectionKeys);
* All metadata keys must be registered. This implies that when using local metadata keys, one must call `create_asset` and `register_asset_metadata_local_type` before calling `create_nft_collection`;

Once the dispatchable succeeds, a unique ID is tied to the NFT collection.

### Issuing an NFT 

After creating the collection, tokens can be issued with the [`issue_nft`](https://docs.polymesh.live/pallet_nft/struct.Module.html#arguments-1) extrinsic. For successfully issuing an NFT, the following conditions must hold:
* An NFT collection associated with `ticker` must exist;
* The caller must have the proper permission for the `Asset`;
* The `portfolio_kind` of the caller must be valid;
* All metadata keys specified in the NFT collection must be set when issuing the token. Attempting to issue a token with metadata keys not defined in the collection will also fail;
  
Once the dispatchable succeeds, a unique non-fungible token is linked to the specified portfolio. 

### Redeeming an NFT 

A non-fungible token can be redeemed by calling the [`redeem_nft`](https://docs.polymesh.live/pallet_nft/struct.Module.html#arguments-2) dispatchable.For successfully redeeming an NFT, the following conditions must hold: 
* An NFT collection associated with `ticker` must exist;
* The caller must have the proper permission for the `Asset`;
* The `nft_id` of the token must exist in the caller's portfolio;
  
Once the dispatchable succeeds, the non-fungible token will no longer be linked to caller's portfolio.

## NFTs and the Settlement pallet

Polymesh's [Settlement](https://developers.polymesh.network/polymesh-docs/primitives/settlement/#overview) engine fully supports NFTs, and transferring of non-fungible tokens go through the same process as fungible assets. This means that all compliance rules defined for the underlying asset must be respected for a successful transfer of an NFT.
