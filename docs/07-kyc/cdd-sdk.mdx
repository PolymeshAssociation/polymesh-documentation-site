:::tip

You ought to look at the previous chapter on _KYC with the SDK_ first.

:::

A CDD service provider is a privileged KYC service provider with a permissioned role to create DID's and add CDD claims to DID's.

:::tip

See the [introduction on identity](/docs/introduction/identity/) for a refresher.

:::

In particular:

1. For **brand new users** of Polymesh, the CDD provider needs to:
   1. Create a new account controlled by the primary key asked by the user, and return the **DID** to the user;
   2. Add a CDD claim to that DID to verify they have gone through verification with them;
2. For **existing users** that need a new CDD attestation, the CDD provider needs to re-verify the individual or entity and attach a new CDD claim to their existing DID;

:::tip

See [distribute with the SDK](/docs/distribute/with-sdk/) for a reminder of the process.

:::

We assume the CDD service provider is named EzCdd and has a way to instantiate a Polymesh client.

      {

      },
    ],

const apiEzCdd: Polymesh = await Polymesh.connect({

## How to create a new account

This part only applies if the user, say Bob, is brand new to Polymesh, or if Bob wants to create another account for himself.

In that case, the CDD provider needs to create an account. This is a privileged operation, too, one that only a CDD service provider can accomplish. The CDD provider needs to ask Bob for the public key, or address, he wishes to associate with the account.

### Information collection

Bob creates a private key and returns the computed address. For instance:

<Tabs groupId="code-language">
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts
const bobAddress: string = '5ED27JHWh9dPVnhvRfazMRNqrfMgcAUdvgD7hs3969PBuxqe'; // For instance
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem
 value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const bobAddress = '5ED27JHWh9dPVnhvRfazMRNqrfMgcAUdvgD7hs3969PBuxqe'; // For instance
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The provider needs to confirm that this key is not yet assigned to any other account.

<Tabs groupId="code-language">
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts
const bobKeyInfo: Account = apiEzCdd.accountManagement.getAccount({
  address: bobAddress,
});
const bob: Identity = await bobKeyInfo.getIdentity();
assert(bob === null);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem
 value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const bobKeyInfo = apiEzCdd.accountManagement.getAccount({
  address: bobAddress,
});
const bob = await bobKeyInfo.getIdentity();
assert(bob === null);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Create the account

With the certainty that **the key is not associated with any existing account**, it is time to create a new account with this key:

<Tabs groupId="code-language">
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts
const newAccountQueue: TransactionQueue<Identity> =
  await apiEzCdd.identities.registerIdentity({
    targetAccount: bobAddress,
  });
const bob: Identity = await newAccountQueue.run();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem
 value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const newAccountQueue = await apiEzCdd.identities.registerIdentity({
  targetAccount: bobAddress,
});
const bob = await newAccountQueue.run();
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

So does Bob have a new account on-chain? Not yet, sadly. Or rather, fortunately. You see, it is worth repeating that all actions of consequence need approval on both ends, and this is no different here. Bob needs to use his private key to approve having it associated with this new account.

So, either Bob goes to his Portal, and looks for incoming authorisation requests, or Bob fires up his own `apiBob` and uses the SDK. We assume that EzCdd gave him their `const ezCddDid: string`.

<Tabs groupId="code-language">
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts
const bobAccount: Account = apiBob.accountManagement.getSigningAccount();
const pendingAuthorizations: AuthorizationRequest[] =
  await bobAccount.authorizations.getReceived();
const ezCddAuthorization: AuthorizationRequest = pendingAuthorizations.find(
  (pendingAuthorization: AuthorizationRequest) => {
    return pendingAuthorization.issuer.did === ezCddDid;
  }
);
const acceptQueue: TransactionQueue<void> = await ezCddAuthorization.accept();
await acceptQueue.run();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem
 value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const bobAccount = apiBob.accountManagement.getSigningAccount();
const pendingAuthorizations = await bobAccount.authorizations.getReceived();
const ezCddAuthorization = pendingAuthorizations.find(
  (pendingAuthorization) => {
    return pendingAuthorization.issuer.did === ezCddDid;
  }
);
const acceptQueue = await ezCddAuthorization.accept();
await acceptQueue.run();
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

There is only a _slight problem_ with the above. Bob has not yet received his CDD attestation, and therefore cannot publish a transaction to the Polymesh network. So we showed the above to _stay in context_, but really, Bob has to wait for the below CDD attestation to be published before he can approve, or reject, the account association.

Additionally, the address needs some POLYX to pay for transaction fees. Bob can purchase them from an exchange, or he can have an agreement with EzCdd to send some to his address. Once again, only after the CDD attestation has been published.

## The CDD attestation

Before an account can transact on chain it requires a valid CDD claim to be added to the DID. The CDD provider constructs a transaction to add a claim type of `CustomerDueDiligence` providing Bob's DID as the target and an expiry date for the claim. The claim can include an optional `cddId` should the CDD provider wish to use it as a reference.

<Tabs groupId="code-language">
<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts
const nextYear: Date = new Date();
nextYear.setFullYear(nextYear.getFullYear() + 1);
const cddClaimQueue: TransactionQueue<void> = await apiEzCdd.claims.addClaims({
  claims: [
    {
      claim: {
        type: ClaimType.CustomerDueDiligence,
        id: cddId,
      },
      target: bob.did,
      expiry: nextYear,
    },
  ],
});
await cddClaimQueue.run();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem
 value="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const nextYear = new Date();
nextYear.setFullYear(nextYear.getFullYear() + 1);
const cddClaimQueue = await apiEzCdd.claims.addClaims({
  claims: [
    {
      claim: {
        type: ClaimType.CustomerDueDiligence,
        id: cddId,
      },
      target: bob.did,
      expiry: nextYear,
    },
  ],
});
await cddClaimQueue.run();
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

With this transaction submitted Bob is now _CDD'd_ and can transact in materially-significant ways, including, as mentioned earlier by accepting the authorisation request.

## Conclusion

We have seen how a CDD service provider needs to:

- create new accounts on Polymesh, and
- publish CDD attestations.
