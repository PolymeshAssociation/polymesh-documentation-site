### Overview

Welcome to the Polymesh Bug Bounty Program.
Polymesh is the software that powers the nodes of the Polymesh blockchain. We want Polymesh to be robust and be the best it can be. This is where we need your help, to assist us in finding bugs and vulnerabilities. Confirmed bugs or vulnerabilities will get monetary rewards (bounty). Please see our Rules & Rewards section for more details.

To get started, Read the [Rules](/docs/community/bug-bounty-rules) and the [Developer Documentation](/docs/quickstart/up-in-ten-minutes/), to learn about how to setup Polymesh and how to approach the bug bounty program.

Having some prior knowledge about capital markets and Rust language can be beneficial. If you have still have any questions, reach out to us on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ud2deWAnyt), or email us at [bugbounty@polymesh.network](mailto:bugbounty@polymesh.network).

You can also submit the bug reports on our Bug Bounty program on Immunefi.

### Bounty Scope

The bug bounty will be applicable for the following repositories, sources and sites:

- [https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/Polymesh/releases/tag/v5.2.0](https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/Polymesh/releases/tag/v5.2.0)
- [https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/cryptography/tree/confidential-identity-v2](https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/cryptography/tree/confidential-identity-v2)

Following are **_out of scope_**:

- [https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/Polymesh/tree/develop/contracts](https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/Polymesh/tree/develop/contracts)
- “test” code - i.e. javascript integration tests or unit tests are not in scope.

### Rules

- Rewards will be decided on a per case basis. This bug bounty program's terms and conditions are at the sole discretion of the Polymesh Association.
- Rewards will vary depending on the severity of the issue.
- Disclose the bug only on the platforms approved by us (Federacy/Immunefi). Do not disclose a bug or vulnerability anywhere else to the public. Doing such would disqualify it from being considered for a reward.
- The bugs being considered for the reward are based on first come first serve basis, duplicate bugs will not be considered.
- If you want to add more information to a provided issue, edit the original report, do not create a new submission.
- Other variables considered for rewards include: the quality of the issue description, the instructions for reproducibility, and the quality of the fix (if included).
- Determinations of eligibility, score and all terms related to an award are at the sole and final discretion of the Polymesh Association.
- Submissions needs to be related with the Bounty Scope. Submissions out of the Bounty Scope won't be eligible for a reward.
- Any interference with the protocol, client or platform services, on purpose or not during the process will make the submission process invalid.
- It is mandatory to read and follow the responsible disclosure policy available in the references. Submissions not following the disclosure policy will not be eligible for a reward.
- By participating in the Polymesh Bug Bounty program, you agree to abide by the [terms and condition](/docs/community/bug-bounty-rules) of the program.

We may modify the terms or terminate this program at any time.
