# Overview

STO stands for Security Token Offering, a fundraising method that involves issuing tokens representing ownership of a real-world asset or security. Polymesh is a blockchain that is designed specifically for security tokens, with a focus on compliance, governance, and regulatory requirements.

Once an asset is created you are able to take that and create an STO to raise funds by exchanging your token for a stablecoin or other asset.

::: note
It is important to note that the specific steps and requirements for launching an STO on Polymesh may vary depending on your specific needs and the legal and regulatory requirements in your jurisdiction. Selling security tokens results in the application of an extensive set of laws, regulations, and potential liabilities. It's always advisable to consult with legal and financial experts to ensure that you comply with all applicable laws and regulations before you proceed with your STO.
Polymesh does not provide any advice or assurance your security tokens comply with applicable laws and regulations.
