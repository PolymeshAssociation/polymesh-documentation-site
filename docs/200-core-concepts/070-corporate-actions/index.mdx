## Overview

Corporate Actions (CAs) are events initiated by an asset issuer that affect the asset or its holders. Polymesh provides a framework for managing various CAs on-chain, automating processes like [capital distributions](/corporate-actions/distributions) and [shareholder voting](/corporate-actions/on-chain-voting).

The Polymesh Corporate Actions functionality is primarily handled by three pallets:

1.  **`corporateAction`**: The base layer for initiating CAs, managing record dates, linking documents, and defining core parameters like taxes and target identities.
2.  **`capitalDistribution`**: Manages the distribution of benefits (payments, dividends, interest, etc.) linked to a CA. See [Capital Distribution](/corporate-actions/distributions).
3.  **`corporateBallot`**: Handles on-chain voting linked to a CA. See [On-Chain Voting](/corporate-actions/on-chain-voting).

Corporate actions may trigger registration or filing requirements with applicable securities regulators or other governmental authorities. Always consult with legal and financial advisors before initiating a corporate action.

## Core Concepts

- **Corporate Action (CA)**: An on-chain record representing an event related to a specific [asset](/core/assets). Each CA has a unique ID (`CAId`) composed of the asset's internal `AssetId` (UUID) and a sequential ID specific to that asset. The sequential ID is automatically assigned when a CA is created, starting at 0 and incrementing for each new CA associated with the same asset. When referencing a CA in API calls, both the asset ID and this local sequential ID are required to uniquely identify the specific corporate action.
- **Corporate Action Agent (CAA)**: An identity authorized to manage CAs for an asset. By default, this is the asset issuer, but it can be delegated to another identity as an [Agent](/asset-agents) of the asset.
- **Record Date**: The specific point in time, defined by a [Checkpoint](/corporate-actions/checkpoints), used to determine holder entitlements (e.g., who receives dividends or can vote).
- **CA Kind**: The type of corporate action, determining its purpose and associated functionality (e.g., `IssuerNotice`, `Reorganization`, `PredictableBenefit`, `UnpredictableBenefit`, `Other`).
- **Declaration Date**: The date the CA was officially declared by the issuer (off-chain). Recorded for informational purposes.
- **Taxes**: Optional withholding tax percentages (default and DID-specific) applied to distributions.
- **Targets**: The set of identities eligible to participate in the CA. By default, all asset holders are targeted, but this can be customized (e.g., include/exclude specific identities).
- **Documents**: Off-chain documents (e.g., prospectuses, notices) can be linked to a CA for reference.

## Corporate Action Lifecycle

### 1. (Optional) Set Asset-Level Defaults

To simplify repeated CA creation, the CAA can set default configurations at the asset level:

- **Default Withholding Tax**: Use `corporateAction::set_default_withholding_tax` to set a standard tax rate for distributions related to this asset.
- **DID-Specific Withholding Tax**: Use `corporateAction::set_did_withholding_tax` to set custom tax rates for specific identities.
- **Default Targets**: Use `corporateAction::set_default_targets` to define a standard set of included/excluded identities for CAs of this asset.

:::info Immutability of CA Parameters after Creation
When a CA is created, the asset-level defaults (target identities and tax withholding) are **copied** into the CA structure. Subsequent changes to asset-level defaults will only affect future CAs, not existing ones.

- You can modify asset-level defaults at any time using the functions above
- Changes to defaults don't affect existing CAs or their active distributions
- Once a CA is created, most of its parameters (including targets and tax settings) cannot be modified
- Only the record date can be modified (using `change_record_date`) and only before a distribution starts

This design ensures that ongoing distributions maintain consistent parameters throughout their lifecycle, regardless of changes to asset-level defaults.

### 2. Initiate Corporate Action

This is the **essential first step** for any on-chain distribution or voting process. The CAA creates the CA record using `corporateAction::initiate_corporate_action`.

**Parameters**:

- `asset_id`: The internal `AssetId` (UUID) of the target asset.
- `kind`: The type of Corporate Action:
  - `PredictableBenefit`/`UnpredictableBenefit`: For distributions like dividends
  - `IssuerNotice`: For ballots/voting
  - `Reorganization`: For reorganization of tokens
  - `Other`: For generic uncategorised CAs
- `decl_date`: The off-chain declaration date (timestamp).
- `details`: Free-form text description (bytes) (max length defined by `maxDetailsLength`).
- `targets` (Optional): Specify target identities if different from the asset default or all holders.
- `default_withholding_tax` (Optional): Override the asset's default tax rate for this CA.
- `withholding_tax` (Optional): Provide DID-specific tax rates for this CA, overriding asset defaults.
- `record_date` (Optional): Specifies the checkpoint to use as the record date. Can be:
  - An existing Checkpoint ID.
  - A future timestamp for a scheduled Checkpoint.
  - An existing Checkpoint Schedule ID.

:::note
While the `record_date` is an optional parameter when initiating a corporate action it is mandatory one is set before attaching a distribution or ballot to the CA.
:::

**Effects**:

- Creates the CA record on-chain with a unique `CAId`.
- Establishes the core parameters (kind, record date, taxes, targets) for subsequent actions like distributions or voting.

### 3. Attach Specific Functionality (Distribution/Voting)

Once the CA is initiated, specific functionality can be attached based on its `kind`:

- **For `PredictableBenefit`, `UnpredictableBenefit`**: Attach a distribution using `capitalDistribution::distribute` (or use the combined `corporateAction::initiate_corporate_action_and_distribute`). See [Capital Distribution](/corporate-actions/distributions) for details.
- **For `IssuerNotice`**: Attach a ballot using `corporateBallot::attach_ballot` (or use the combined `corporateAction::initiate_corporate_action_and_ballot`). See [On-Chain Voting](/corporate-actions/on-chain-voting) for details.

:::tip Combined Initiation and Distribution
For convenience, the `corporateAction` pallet provides the `initiate_corporate_action_and_distribute` and `initiate_corporate_action_and_ballot` extrinsics. These allows the Corporate Action Agent to initiate the CA (providing target `AssetId`, etc.) and create the associated distribution or ballot in a single transaction.
:::

### 4. Manage the Corporate Action (Optional)

After initiation, the CAA can manage certain aspects:

- **Change Record Date**: Use `corporateAction::change_record_date` to modify the record date _before_ the associated distribution/ballot starts, provided the CA `kind` allows it.
- **Link Documents**: Use `corporateAction::link_ca_doc` to link supporting documents to the corporate action.
- **Remove Corporate Action**: Use `corporateAction::remove_ca` to remove a CA, typically after it's completed or if it needs to be cancelled before activation. This will also remove any associated distributions or ballots if they haven't yet started.
