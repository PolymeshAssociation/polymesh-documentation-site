# How Confidential Assets Compare to Other Privacy Approaches

Polymesh Confidential Assets (PCA) are not “just ZK”. They target **full anonymity**, an **account-based model**, and a **regulated settlement (transfers) workflow** (receiver affirmation, optional mediation, and scoped audit access).

This page gives a conceptual comparison to other common privacy approaches.

## Property Matrix

The matrix below summarizes practical properties across representative systems. Symbols: ✓ = supported; ✗ = not supported; △ = possible with reasonable modifications. Transaction size is shown relative to anonymity parameter `k`.

Notes:

- ✓\* under “Full anonymity” indicates systems that target small user sets.
- ✓\* under “Receiver affirmation” reflects interactive designs where receiver affirmation is inherent.
- This summary is adapted from public research for clarity; naming and headings are adjusted for implementation focus.

## A quick mental model

- **UTXO privacy systems** (Zcash-style): spend and create notes; anonymity sets are often phrased in terms of coins/notes.
- **Account-based privacy systems** (Zether-style): balances live under accounts; transactions often form an anonymity ring of size `k`.
- **Polymesh Confidential Assets**: keep an account-style abstraction while targeting full anonymity and constant-size on-chain proofs, and add regulated-transfer mechanics.

## Compared to UTXO-based shielded payments (Zerocash/Zcash-style)

Similarities:

- Both rely on commitments + zero-knowledge proofs.
- Both use nullifier-like constructs to prevent double-use.
- Both can have constant-size transactions relative to anonymity set size.

Key differences:

- **Bookkeeping model:** UTXO systems distribute a user's balance across many notes; Confidential Assets use account-style state transitions.
- **Proof of balance:** Confidential Assets target PoB (with counters and optional counter-updates). UTXO designs typically don't provide PoB out of the box because balances are spread across many notes.
- **Receiver affirmation:** Confidential Assets include accept/reject semantics as a first-class feature.
- **Settlement legs:** Confidential Assets are designed around multi-leg settlement (transfers) workflows (more like capital-markets settlement than simple payments).

## Compared to ring-based privacy (Monero-style)

Ring-based systems typically provide sender ambiguity via ring signatures and often have transaction size that grows with the ring size `k`.

PCA target:

- larger anonymity sets (conceptually “all participants”),
- constant-size on-chain proofs relative to anonymity set size,
- explicit regulatory flow (affirmation, mediation, auditing).

## Compared to account-based rings (Zether / Anonymous Zether-style)

These designs often select a ring of size `k` (sender/receiver plus dummies) and prove correctness over that ring.

Typical trade-offs in ring-based account privacy:

- transaction size and verification work can scale with `k`,
- concurrency constraints (epoch-based updates, state rollovers) may appear,
- anonymity depends on ring selection.

The design goal is to avoid a small fixed `k` anonymity set and to avoid requiring validators to touch “every account” on each transaction.

## Compared to mixers and application-layer privacy

Mixers can provide unlinkability for specific assets but usually:

- don't integrate receiver-affirmation style settlement,
- don't provide per-asset compliance access controls,
- may not support multi-leg regulated settlement flows.

PCA bake these requirements into the protocol design.

## Compared to privacy rollups

Rollups can hide details inside an off-chain execution environment and publish proofs/data to L1.

PCA differ in that:

- settlement workflow and compliance hooks are designed at the protocol level,
- the model is described as an account-based anonymous payment/settlement system rather than a general-purpose private VM.

## Benefits and trade-offs (practical)

Benefits:

- Regulated-market semantics (receiver affirmation, mediation).
- Scoped compliance access (auditors/mediators per asset type).
- Full anonymity goal with constant-size on-chain proofs.

Trade-offs:

- Proof generation cost and client complexity (wallets typically need to track state and scan for relevant legs).
- PoB is non-trivial: counters and counter-updates exist to balance verifiability against privacy leakage.
- Key management becomes more complex (account keys, encryption keys, and signing keys).
