# Asset Operations

This page explains how to create a confidential asset, register confidential accounts for that asset, and mint balances.

What you can do here:

- Create a confidential asset with issuer-embedded compliance hooks (auditors and/or mediators)
- Register confidential accounts for that asset (asset-specific state commitments)
- Mint supply while keeping prior balances private

## Prerequisites

- A Polymesh DID and signing key to submit transactions
- A proof service (e.g., WASM library or remote prover) with your confidential account and encryption keys loaded
- Auditor and/or mediator encryption keys if the asset requires compliance participants

## 1) Create a confidential asset

Define the asset and its compliance configuration, then publish it on-chain.

- Capture asset details (name, symbol, decimals, optional metadata).
- Assign compliance participants: auditors for retrospective visibility and/or mediators for prospective control; provide their encryption public keys. (A minimum of one is required)
- Request the proof service to build the creation proof and submit `createAsset`.
- On success, the chain emits `AssetCreated` with the new asset ID and records the issuer → asset → compliance keys mapping for future lookups.

Outcomes:

- Asset exists on-chain with its compliance hooks baked in.
- Regulatory metadata is visible (who the issuer is and which auditor/mediator keys apply) without revealing any balances or future transactions.

## 2) Register your account for the asset

Confidential accounts are asset-specific: the same key can register many assets, but each asset gets its own state commitment. This keeps proving scoped to the asset you are using.

- Prerequisites: your confidential account is registered on-chain and confidential account keys are available to the proof service.
- Generate a **register-account-asset proof** that proves ownership of the account keys and initializes a zero balance for the chosen asset.
- Submit `registerAccountAssets` with the proof; cache the returned state commitment and leaf path locally.

Outcomes:

- The account is linked to the asset. The asset registration of the confidential account is publicly visible.
- A zero-balance commitment for that asset is inserted into the curve-tree accumulator; nothing about balances is revealed.

## 3) Mint supply (issuer only)

Minting increases supply for the issuer while keeping prior balances confidential.

- Prerequisites: issuer's account-asset state and leaf path available to the proof service.
- Produce a **minting proof**: spend the old state, reveal a nullifier for it, and create a new state commitment with the increased balance.
- Submit `mintAsset` with the proof; persist the updated state and leaf path for future actions.

Outcomes:

- Public total supply increases; the issuer's new confidential balance is committed on-chain, and the spent state is prevented from reuse via its nullifier.
- The old balance remains hidden; only the new commitment and proof validity are public.

## Operational tips

- Keep encrypted backups of account-asset state (commitments, leaf paths, counters) after each successful transaction.
- When using a remote proof service, encrypt seeds/state in transit and at rest.
