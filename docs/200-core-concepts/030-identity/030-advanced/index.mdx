# Advanced Identity Features

Identity in Polymesh extends beyond basic concepts with powerful features designed for enterprise-grade security, flexibility, and control. This section covers advanced identity mechanisms that enable sophisticated access control, delegation, and organizational structures.

## Key Topics

- **[Secondary Keys](/identity/advanced/keys)** - Delegate specific permissions to different keys while maintaining granular control
- **[Multisigs](/identity/advanced/multisig)** - Create multi-signature structures requiring approval from multiple parties
- **[Authorizations](/authorizations)** - Manage permission requests between identities and keys
- **[Child Identities](/identity/advanced/child)** - Create subsidiary DIDs derived from a parent identity
- **[Subsidized Accounts](/accounts/subsidized)** - Configure accounts where one entity pays transaction fees for another

These features work together to provide comprehensive identity management capabilities for institutional use cases while maintaining regulatory compliance.
