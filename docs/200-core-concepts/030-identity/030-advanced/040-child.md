## Overview

Child identities facilitate the creation of multiple DIDs on Polymesh by enabling existing users to generate new DIDs derived from a parent identity's CDD claim. An unlimited number of child identities can be created and associated with a parent identity.

## Common Use Cases

Child identities are useful for various organizational and security needs:

- **Smart Contract Isolation**: Create a separate identity for a smart contract to protect user funds managed by the contract, ensuring it operates independently of the deployer's identity.

- **Enhanced Security Structure**: Use child identities as "hot wallets" while retaining the parent identity as a "cold wallet" to secure assets. This structure permits separate identities for hot/cold wallet functions.

- **Organizational Hierarchy**: Structure an organization through child identities, such as assigning individual identities to different departments or subsidiaries.

Keys linked to a child identity are fully independent of those of the parent identity; the parent cannot directly access assets held by a child identity.

## Technical Implementation

### Prerequisites

To create child identities, you need:

1. A parent identity with a valid CDD claim
2. Access to the parent identity's primary key
3. New key pair(s) for the child identity/identities

### Creation Methods

There are two methods for creating child identities, each with different requirements and processes:

#### Child Identity Creation from Secondary Key

Using `identity::create_child_identity`:

- Requires the new child key to already be associated as a [secondary key](/identity/advanced/keys) of the parent identity
- Immediately converts the secondary key into the primary key of the new child identity
- No additional authorization step is needed
- Direct and immediate creation process

#### Child Identity Creation from Unlinked Keys

Using `identity::create_child_identities`:

- Can create multiple child identities in one transaction
- Each child identity creation requires:
  - The unassigned key to be used as the primary key
  - An off-chain authorization signature from that key
- The authorization signature must be generated by the future child key signing data containing:
  - The target Identity's DID (future parent)
  - The parent identity's off-chain authorization nonce (retrieved via `identity::offchain_authorization_nonce`)
  - An expiry date for the authorization

This method enables bulk creation of child identities without first linking the keys to the parent identity.

:::info
Only the primary key of the parent identity can initiate either creation process.

### Capabilities and Limitations

Once established, a child identity:

- Receives a unique DID
- Can hold claims and assets independently
- Inherits the parent's CDD status
- Can receive additional compliance claims directly
- Cannot create its own child identities (no recursive child identities)

## Unlinking Child Identities

Child identities can be detached from their parent when needed. This process requires:

1. Initiation by either:
   - The parent identity's primary key, or
   - The child identity's primary key
2. Calling the `identity::unlink_child_identity` extrinsic with the child's DID as an argument

:::note
After unlinking, the child identity loses its inherited CDD status and must obtain its own CDD claim to continue transacting on the chain.
