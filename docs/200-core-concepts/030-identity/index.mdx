## Overview

Identity is at the core of Polymesh. All network participants must have an on-chain identity to interact with the blockchain and its assets.

Each identity:

- Is created through a [Customer Due Diligence (CDD) process](/identity/verification)
- Is referenced by a pseudo-anonymous decentralized identifier (DID), e.g., `0xfc0d2fc058d02c0a89c2cc2ff11726971dd39886a0b80ecfaa80fa3f196d65ce`
- Can hold [assets](/core/assets) in associated [portfolios](/portfolios), [claims](/compliance/#claims), and [permissioned roles](/identity/roles)
- Is controlled by a [primary key](/identity/advanced/primary-keys) and optional [secondary keys](/identity/advanced/secondary-keys)

## Key Concepts

### Identity Creation & Verification

Identities are created through [permissioned CDD service providers](/identity/verification#cdd-service-providers) who verify user information, create an on-chain DID and issue CDD claims required for network access.

### Asset Management

Native [assets](/core/assets) (excluding [POLYX](/polyx)) held by users are associated with their identities and can be organized into [portfolios](/portfolios). Each identity can hold multiple assets and manage them through different portfolios. Identities may also be granted [agent permissions](/asset-agents) to perform specific operations on behalf of asset issuers.

### Claims & Compliance

Identities can receive [claims](/compliance#claims) from other identities, which are used to enforce on-chain [compliance rules](/compliance) for assets. Claims have specific [scopes](/compliance#claim-scopes) and can be used to represent various attributes, such as KYC status or accreditation.

### Key Management

Each identity has:

- A single [primary key](/identity/advanced/secondary-keys#relationship-to-primary-key) with full control
- Optional [secondary keys](/identity/advanced/secondary-keys) with configurable permissions
- Support for [multisig](/identity/advanced/multisig) keys as either primary or secondary keys
- Support for [smart contracts](/development/smart-contracts/) as either primary or secondary keys
- The ability to create [child identities](/identity/advanced/child)

Keys can also enter into a [subsidized](/accounts/subsidized/) relationship with another key, allowing the subsidizer to pay transaction fees on its behalf.

### Access Control

Polymesh provides robust [authorization](/authorizations) and [permission](/identity/advanced/secondary-keys#secondary-key-permissions) frameworks to manage access between identities and their keys.

## Identity Diagrams

The following diagrams help visualize and clarify the relationships between key aspects of on-chain identities in Polymesh. Each diagram focuses on a specific concept, such as [Customer Due Diligence (CDD)](/identity/verification), [primary and secondary keys](/identity/advanced/secondary-keys), [portfolios](/portfolios), [custody](/portfolios/custody), [claims and compliance](/compliance), [agent permissions](/asset-agents), [subsidized accounts](/accounts/subsidized), and [secondary key permissions](/identity/advanced/secondary-keys#secondary-key-permissions). For more details, see the linked documentation pages for each topic.

### Identity Onboarding & CDD

This diagram shows how a user is onboarded to Polymesh through a [CDD (Customer Due Diligence) provider](/identity/verification), resulting in the creation of an on-chain identity and issuance of a [CDD claim](/identity/verification#cdd-claims).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    User["User"]
    CDD["CDD Provider"]
    OnboardID["Creates on-chain Identity ID"]
    CDDClaim["Generates CDD claim<br/>and adds on-chain to Identity"]
    User -->|"Provides identity<br/>verification Data<br/>and primary signing key"| CDD
    CDD --> OnboardID
    CDD --> CDDClaim
    OnboardID --> MainDID["On-chain Identity (DID)"]
    CDDClaim --> MainDID
```

### Keys & Accounts

This diagram shows how an identity (DID) is controlled by signing keys. Both the [primary key](/identity/advanced/primary-keys) and any number of optional [secondary keys](/identity/advanced/secondary-keys) are grouped in a "Signing Keys" subgraph. Each key can be a standard signing key (SR25519, ED25519, or ECDSA), a [multisig](/identity/advanced/multisig), or a [smart contract](/development/smart-contracts/).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    MainDID["On-chain Identity (DID)"]
    POLYX["POLYX Balance"]
    subgraph SG1 ["Signing Keys"]
        direction TB
        style SG1 stroke-dasharray: 4
        PrimKey["Primary Key"]
        SecKey["Secondary Key(s) (optional)"]
    end
    MainDID --> SG1
    POLYX --> SG1
    subgraph SG2 ["Allowed Key Types"]
        direction TB
        style SG2 stroke-dasharray: 4
        StdKey["Standard Signing Key (SR25519/ED25519/ECDSA)"]
        MultiSig["Multisig (m of n)"]
        SmartContract["Smart Contract"]
    end
    PrimKey & SecKey --> SG2
    MultiSig --> Signer1["Standard Signing Key (SR25519/ED25519/ECDSA)<br/>(No associated with a DID)"]
```

### Secondary Key Permissions

Secondary keys can be granted fine-grained [permissions](/identity/advanced/secondary-keys#secondary-key-permissions), allowing them to perform only specific actions or access certain resources. Permissions can be scoped to:

- **Assets**: Restrict which assets the key can interact with (e.g., only certain tokens).
- **Portfolios**: Restrict which portfolios the key can access or manage.
- **Transactions**: Restrict which types of transactions the key can sign (e.g., transfers, settlements, etc.).

The diagram below illustrates how secondary key permissions can be configured:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    SecKey["Secondary Key"]
    Permissions["Permissions"]
    SecKey --> Permissions
    Permissions --> AssetPerms["Asset Permissions"]
    Permissions --> PortfolioPerms["Portfolio Permissions"]
    Permissions --> TxPerms["Transaction Permissions"]
    AssetPerms --> Asset1["Asset A"]
    AssetPerms --> Asset2["Asset B"]
    PortfolioPerms --> Portfolio1["Portfolio 1"]
    PortfolioPerms --> Portfolio2["Portfolio 2"]
    TxPerms --> Transfer["Settlement"]
    TxPerms --> Settle["Asset"]
    TxPerms --> OtherTx["Other Transaction Types"]
```

### Portfolios & Asset Management

This diagram demonstrates how an identity can have multiple [portfolios](/portfolios) (default, user, custodial) to organize and manage [assets](/core/assets), including both fungible and non-fungible tokens.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    MainDID["On-chain Identity (DID)"]
    DefPortfolio["Default Portfolio"]
    UserPortfolio["User Portfolio"]
    CustodialPortfolio["Custodial Portfolio"]
    AddUserPortfolios["Additional User Portfolios"]
    AssetA["Asset A"]
    AssetB["Asset B"]
    AssetC["Asset C"]
    MainDID --> DefPortfolio
    MainDID --> UserPortfolio
    MainDID --> AddUserPortfolios
    MainDID --> CustodialPortfolio
    DefPortfolio --> AssetA
    UserPortfolio --> AssetB
    CustodialPortfolio --> AssetC
    AddUserPortfolios --> AssetB
    AddUserPortfolios --> AssetC
```

### Custody & Portfolio Control

This diagram shows how portfolio [control/custody](/portfolios/custody) can be assigned to another identity (the custodian), who then controls the portfolio's assets.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    OwnerID["Owner Identity"]
    CustodialPortfolio["Custodial Portfolio"]
    CustodianID["Custodian Identity"]
    CustodianKeys["Custodian Signing Keys"]
    AssetA["Asset A"]
    AssetB["Asset B"]

    OwnerID -->|"Owner retains beneficial ownership but cannot transfer"| CustodialPortfolio
    CustodialPortfolio --> AssetA
    CustodialPortfolio --> AssetB
    CustodianID -->|"Custodian has exclusive control of assets"| CustodialPortfolio
    CustodianKeys --> CustodianID
```

---

### Claims & Compliance

This diagram illustrates how [claims](/compliance#claims) (such as KYC or accreditation) are issued to an identity by a claim issuer (e.g., a [CDD provider](/identity/verification) or another identity), and how they are used for [compliance](/compliance) purposes. Multiple claims from different issuers can be attached to a single identity and may be scoped to specific assets, identities or custom identifiers.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    MainDID["On-chain Identity (DID)"]
    Claim1["KYC Claim<br/>Asset A"]
    Claim2["Accreditation Claim<br/>Asset A"]
    Claim3["KYC Claim<br/>Asset B"]
    Claim4["Jurisdiction Claim<br/>Asset B"]
    ClaimIssuer["Claim Issuer 1"]
    ClaimIssuer2["Claim Issuer 2"]
    ClaimIssuer -->|"Issues"| Claim1
    ClaimIssuer -->|"Issues"| Claim2
    ClaimIssuer2 -->|"Issues"| Claim3
    ClaimIssuer2 -->|"Issues"| Claim4
    Claim1 --> MainDID
    Claim2 --> MainDID
    Claim3 --> MainDID
    Claim4 --> MainDID
```

### Agent Permissions

This diagram shows how an identity can grant [agent permissions](/asset-agents) to another identity, allowing the agent to act on behalf of the original identity for specific assets or operations. The asset issuer is an agent for its own asset by default.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    MainDID["On-chain Identity (DID)"]
    AgentID["Agent Identity"]
    Asset["Asset"]
    MainDID -->|"Owns and controls<br/>(Issuer is an agent by default)"| Asset
    MainDID -->|"Grants agent permission"| AgentID
    AgentID -->|"Acts on behalf of issuer"| Asset
```

---

### Relayer & Subsidized Keys

This diagram shows how a [relayer](/accounts/subsidized) can subsidize transaction fees for a signing key (not directly for an identity), allowing another key (owned by a relayer identity) to pay fees on behalf of a key. The relayer's key may be under a different identity than the subsidized key.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    MainDID["On-chain Identity (DID)"]
    KeyToSubsidize["Key to be Subsidized"]
    MainDID --> KeyToSubsidize
    RelayerID["Relayer Identity"]
    RelayerKey["Relayer Signing Key"]
    RelayerID --> RelayerKey
    KeyToSubsidize -.->|"Transaction fees subsidized by"| RelayerKey
    MainDID -.->|"Can be the same identity"| RelayerID
```

### Identity Structure: Primary & Sub-Identities

This diagram illustrates the relationship between a primary on-chain identity and its [sub-identities (child identities)](/identity/advanced/child), including inheritance of [CDD claims](/identity/verification#cdd-claims).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    MainDID["On-chain Identity (DID)"]
    SubDID["Sub-Identity (DID)"]
    AddSubDID["Additional Sub-Identities"]
    MainDID --> SubDID
    MainDID --> AddSubDID
    SubDID -.->|"Inherits CDD claim"| MainDID
```
