# Getting Started with Polymesh

Welcome to Polymesh! This guide will walk you through the essential steps to begin using the Polymesh blockchain network. Before you can start creating and managing on-chain assets or participating in the network, there are a few key requirements you'll need to complete.

## What You'll Need

1. [**A Compatible Wallet**](/getting-started/keys) - This is your gateway to interacting with the Polymesh network. The wallet stores your private keys and allows you to sign transactions securely. The [Polymesh wallet](/getting-started/keys/polymesh-wallet) browser extension is a good starting point for those starting out with Polymesh.

2. [**Identity Verification**](/getting-started/onboarding) - Polymesh requires users to onboard through an identity verification process for **identity** and **asset** related transactions. Identity verification is not required for POLYX transfers or staking (except validator activities). This verification assigns you an on-chain Identity and is essential for maintaining regulatory compliance. Once verified, you'll receive a Customer Due Diligence (CDD) claim and an on-chain identity, which enable you to:

   - Create, issue, and manage regulated assets on Polymesh
   - Participate in asset transfers and settlements
   - Access advanced network features such as compliance, confidential assets, and governance proposals
   - Interact with identity-based protocols and services
   - Be assigned permissioned roles

3. [**POLYX Tokens**](/polyx) - POLYX is the native utility token of the Polymesh blockchain. You'll need POLYX to:
   - Pay for transaction fees
   - Participate in network governance
   - Stake tokens to help secure the network and earn rewards
   - Signal on governance issues

## Next Steps

Follow these steps in order to get started:

1. [Install a Polymesh Wallet](/getting-started/keys) - Set up your secure access to the network
2. [Complete Identity Verification](/getting-started/onboarding) - Verify your identity through the CDD process
3. Acquire POLYX - Get tokens to start participating in the network.
   - Purchase from exchanges that list POLYX and transfer to your wallet. See [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polymesh#markets) or [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polymesh/#Markets) for a range of market options.

:::tip Getting Started on Testnet
If you want to try Polymesh without using real assets, you can use the Testnet. After setting up your wallet and completing the mock verification process on Testnet, you'll automatically receive test POLYX tokens to experiment with the network's features.

:::note
Remember that all transactions on Polymesh require both a signing key and a verified identity with a valid CDD claim. Your wallet key must be associated with a verified identity to send or receive POLYX and interact with the network.
