## Create a New Account

Accept the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, then click `Create new account`.

You will be presented with a 12-word mnemonic, which is a recovery phrase that can be used to regenerate the private signing key stored in the wallet. It's essential to store this phrase in a safe and confidential location to retain access to your key.

On the next screen, you'll need to enter the words **_in the correct order_** to confirm you have recorded the phrase accurately.

Check the box to confirm that you've saved the recovery phrase, press `Continue`, and select the words in the correct order.

Give your account a name and set a password. This password will help protect your account and encrypt your keys in local storage.
