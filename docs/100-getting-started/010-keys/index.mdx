Polymesh supports a range of compatible wallets that leverage public-key cryptography using the Ed25519 curve, with support for Ed25519, SR25519, and ECDSA keys. These wallets enable you to manage your Polymesh account, securely store private keys, and interact with the Polymesh blockchain.

Typically, blockchain wallets are either **hot wallets** (connected to the internet, like browser extensions or mobile apps) or **cold wallets** (offline, like hardware devices). With **non-custodial wallets** where only you control your private keys keeping your private key and recovery phrase secure is essential, as access to these is required to manage your account.

Below is a selection of **Polymesh-compatible, non-custodial wallet options** to help you get started.

If you're unsure which wallet to choose, simply use the [**Polymesh Wallet**](/getting-started/keys/polymesh-wallet) extension as a reliable starting point.
