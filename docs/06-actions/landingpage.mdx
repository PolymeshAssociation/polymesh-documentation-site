### Corporate actions

Public companies when implementing changes in regard to securities, equity, or debt, have to perform corporate actions. Polymesh can help move these from the off-chain world to become processes on-chain.

We will dive deeper on Polymesh and corporate actions - the possibilities and the limits - through an example scenario. We will dive deeper building on the introduction by targeting handling corporate actions on Polymesh using the Dashboard and the SDK.
