Signature has to be generated encoding the target Id authorization value in the specified order.

**`Note`**

Nonce value can be fetched using [Identity.getOffChainAuthorizationNonce](../../../../../classes/API/Entities/Identity/Identity.md#getoffchainauthorizationnonce)
Signature can also be generated using the method [accountManagement.generateOffChainAuthSignature](../../../../../classes/API/Client/AccountManagement/AccountManagement.md#generateoffchainauthsignature)
