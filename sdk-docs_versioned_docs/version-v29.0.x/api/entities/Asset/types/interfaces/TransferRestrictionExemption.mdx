# Interface: TransferRestrictionExemption

Defined in: [src/api/entities/Asset/types.ts:500](https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/polymesh-sdk/blob/bee6a2fe7a8ce5db42a6982e793782182cde2153/src/api/entities/Asset/types.ts#L500)

Identities that are exempt from Transfer Restrictions.

## Note

if these entities are removed from exemptions but are
in violation of any Transfer Restrictions then they will only
be able to trade in a manner that brings them more inline. e.g.
Exceeding a percentage restriction means tokens can only be sent
and not received
