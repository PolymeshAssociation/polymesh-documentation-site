Defined in: [src/api/entities/Instruction/types.ts:143](https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/polymesh-sdk/blob/bee6a2fe7a8ce5db42a6982e793782182cde2153/src/api/entities/Instruction/types.ts#L143)

Instructions that failed in their execution (can be rescheduled).
  This group supersedes the other three, so for example, a failed Instruction
  might also belong in the `affirmed` group, but it will only be included in this one

Defined in: [src/api/entities/Instruction/types.ts:137](https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/polymesh-sdk/blob/bee6a2fe7a8ce5db42a6982e793782182cde2153/src/api/entities/Instruction/types.ts#L137)
