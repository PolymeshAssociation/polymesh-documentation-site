1.2.1,Getting a signing key,"Basic - use the polymesh wallet + other 3rd party options. Link to a Developer/Advanced section - SR25519 / ED25519 - Subkey, dev (well known keys) local signer, chrome extensions, signing managers. Need to cater for developers but also for average users. Mention other signing manager e.g. Hashicorp Vault, Fireblocks raw signer and that they other signing solutions can be integrated via custom signing managers."
1.2.1.1,Ledger Hardware Wallet,ledger specific page linked from getting key
1.2.2,Onboarding,Onboarding to polymesh (testnet and mainnet) - Business should contact the association. Need to have a brief introduction about the concept of identity on polymesh so people understand the purpose of onboarding. Can link to a more detailed explanation about identity.
